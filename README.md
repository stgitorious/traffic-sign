# Traffic Signs Recognition with Tensorflow
DD2424 Group Project; Authors: Bergh, Joigneau, Nguyen

Planned features:
- pre-training (using k-means clustering to group the images)
	- visualise test error interval without&with pre-training
	- extend hidden layers of network
	- use restricted boltzmann machines for pre-training
	- use ISOMAP/SOM to reduce network parameters to 2D representation and plot
	- report results, check if pre-training reduced the test accuracy interval, any other improvements?


- (classification based on edge-only images)
- (localisation of traffic signs after classification)
- ...
